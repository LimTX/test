                Cars &amp; Stars Online allows you to group students into the different reading levels that you are teaching to in the classroom. This is done in the "Begin New Level" section. Here you record individual results and monitor overall class performance on a per reading level basis (i.e. CARS level B).
                </p>

            <div style="padding-left:10px;">
            	<p>
              To add your studentâ€™s results into the system, group the results by reading level and select "Begin New Level". Add all your students' results for that level (i.e. CARS level C).

            <div style="padding-left:10px;">
            	<p>
              If you do not complete a level in a session, select "Continue level", to complete the data entry for that reading level.

            <div style="padding-left:10px;">
            	<p>
               If you have completed all the student data from a level ( i.e. CARS level B), and wish to begin entering data for a new reading level (i.e. CARS level C) select "Begin New Level" and record all the individual student data for that reading level.

            	<p>
              You can revisit your level assessment records at anytime by selecting "Assessment Listing" and choosing the appropriate record.
 <br/><br/>
The Assessment Listing shows a record of previously reading levels assessments and the date that the assessment was entered. Here you can edit, or view individual student results
 <br/><br/>
Why do I have more than one Assessment Listing for a particular reading level?
You may have inadvertently selected "Begin New Level" upon resuming a session mid way through adding data to a reading level instead of selecting "Continue Level"
 <br/><br/>
To generate a thorough analysis of your class, we recommend you to create one Assessment for each reading level per class. This ensures each reading level record will contain all the students who are currently on that level. (i.e CARS level C).
 <br/><br/>
If this happens you will need to re-enter the individual student data for that level into one Assessment record and delete the duplicates.
